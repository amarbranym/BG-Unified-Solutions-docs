# **CONTENT**

Building up content for this website was a hectic task. Several prerequisites had to be fulfilled. The target audience was to be set up. Thorough research about the company, all the services, specifications, and a sound technical understanding was the last step to building the content.

The content curation process was completed in set of stages:

**Stage-1 :**

Surfing through the web. Looking at different competitor websites. Researching about what to be published and what not to. Analyzing the workflow. Thorough research about BG Unified Solutions, and its services. Comparison of each and every service with other companies, especially in the Australian market to stand apart from others.

**Stage-2 :**

Categorizing the company pages, the solution pages and all the services, as per their respective domains. Setting up a sitemap and a workflow for the website.

**Stage-3 :**

Structuring content in a different structure for every page, to make the website more attractive. Having perfect taglines for every page to enhance the interest of a user. Creating content in a way so that masses could easily understand the concept. From a layman perspective and from a highly technical person’s perspective as well, the content created was easily understandable.

**Stage-4 :**

Modifying the content as per the reviews and feedback received from the client.

**Stage-5 :**

Once the content was finally approved, now enhancing it as per SEO rules, inclusion of meta tags in the source code, including all the necessary keywords and phrases to increase the ranking of the page.

**Stage-6 :**

Developing the articles, blogs, updates and case studies for the website.

**Categorization of Services** -

The services are categorized according to the nature of the service, their requirements and end-products and the trends followed in searches.

The categories are as follows -

1. IT and Infrastructure Services
2. Network Services
3. Cyber Security Services
4. Collaborative Services
5. Professional Services

If we analyze the trend for “network services” keywords, this is what the results show us.

These are the trends for the last 5 years. And in 2020, the keyword search has been tremendously high, so it was the ideal keyword to select and include.


**Services Pages** -

These pages had the content structured as per the best SEO results that we can get.

1. Every word in the page title and page heading was different, so that we get more number of word combinations for rendering.
2. The structure was designed so that maximum keywords could be included in an easy to understand language, covering all the aspects of that particular service.
3. Use of features in the form of bullets rather than including them as long paragraphs, would be considered a more useful practice, as per user’s perspective.
4. Our motive was to deliver the basic understanding of what we are, how we do, what all we provide,and how we stand a class apart.
5. Every service page has a different structure, just to avoid redundancy and keeping the interest of a user.
6. The **taglines** chosen are very well researched, conveying the basic idea of the service thoroughly.
7. Every tagline is innovative, plagiarism free, and in accordance with the page.
8. For eg - Infrastructure as a service- Store your data with our security and reliability.
9. This is what the tagline has impacted the page, every word serves as a keyword in the trend analysis.
10. Every service page serves as a c**onclusion** to the tagline of the page, serving as a connection between the two, and further rendered as keywords.
11. For eg - Workstation as a service - “An ideal workstation solution for highly sensitive computing environments.”

**OUR FEATURES Page**

Our Features Page basically answers the question, “Why choose BG Unified Solutions for your business?”.

To answer this question, a user needs to find what other firms are not offering. This was a challenging task to give a client, every single and little detail of how BG Unified Solutions stands apart from its competitors. We had to be precise and specific in our content.

We structured the content of our features page, showing only 5 features or 5 Unique Selling Points of BG Unified Solutions. These 5 bullets contain precisely every USP, collaborator, locations, diversity and every detail that a client should know.

Usage of keywords like Efficient, Secure, Geographically redundant, to gain trust of our clients and show our customer-centric nature.

We started the page by showing the big numbers, to show the vast and expanding footprints of BGUS, and giving the customer a solid case to collaborate with the company.

**About Us Page**

The About Us page plays a huge role in attracting business. For someone to trust a firm, he/she should know, who is behind the company, what all they have achieved till now, what are their ethical values, vision and mission, how they have gained such reputation and all those questions need to be answered in a very precise and detailed manner.

Therefore, the About Us page was built with a timeline of BGUS, showing all the noteworthy achievements achieved till now, from its formation.

With numbers, we explained who we are, what we aim for and what our vision is to follow that path.
