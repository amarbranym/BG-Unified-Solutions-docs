# **TESTING**

# **1. Functionality Testing:**

**Testing** of all the **links** in the web pages.Links are working properly and there are no broken links.

- Outgoing links
- Internal links
- Anchor Links
- MailTo Links
- Tel Links

**Test business workflow**- This will include

- Testing the end - to - end workflow/ business scenarios which takes the user through a series of webpages to complete.
- Tested negative scenarios as well, such that when a user executes an unexpected step, appropriate error message or help is shown in your web application.

**Testing that the Forms** are working as expected

## **2. Usability testing:**

**Site Navigation**:

- Menus, buttons or Links to different pages on your site should be easily visible and consistent on all webpages

**Content**:

- Content is relatable with no spelling or grammatical errors.
- All Images contain an "alt" text

## **3.Interface Testing:**

Two areas to be tested here are - Web and Database Server

- **Development Server**: Test Development server is handling all application requests without any service denial.
- **Database Server:** Queries sent to the database give expected results.

## **4. Compatibility testing.**

Compatibility tests ensure that your web application displays correctly across different devices. This would include-

**Browser Compatibility Test**: Same website in different browsers will display differently.We will also check for [](https://www.guru99.com/mobile-testing.html)Mobile Browser Compatibility.

The rendering of web elements like buttons, text fields etc. changes with change in **Operating System**. Making sure the website works fine for various combinations of Operating systems such as Windows, Linux, Mac and Browsers such as Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari etc.

## **5. Performance & Operational Testing:**

- Website application response times at different connection speeds is calculated.
- Load test of the web application to determine its behavior under normal and peak loads
- Stress test your web site to determine its break point when pushed to beyond normal loads at peak time.
- Test if a crash occurs due to peak load, how does the site recover from such an event
- Make sure optimization techniques like zip compression, browser and server side cache enabled to reduce load times

## **6. Beta/Production Testing**

We selected a number of people (crowd) to execute testing, this can be done by user groups or by randomly selected users that match the target audience.
