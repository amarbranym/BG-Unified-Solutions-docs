# **PHASES**

## **Planning**

Planning is the most fundamental and critical organizational phase.In this the system is identified for development. Feasibility assessment of the system is done and the project plan is also created in this phase.

1. Getting all the requirements and needs to get a picture of the final product.
2. Listing the main features the application is going to have.
3. Preparing a list of milestones and their deadlines.
4. Listing the technologies to be used in the development process.
5. Preparing a timeline and assigning tasks to team members.

## **Designing**

It is very essential to know first how the app interacts with the users, and what kind of thing we are delivering to users. A basic prototype (non-functional) is prepared first then given to the users for testing purposes.

## **Content**

Defining & Planning all the functionalities and kind of the content included in the web app. All types of blogs, help content and how the things will work is defined in the very beginning. Seems to be an easy task, but is one of the most tedious jobs.

## **Development**

We’ve come a long way at this point. Client has put in a lot of work, so the development team will do the rest. This part of the process is laborious and time-consuming, so the team will be able to provide presentable output during this phase of the process. But that’s a good thing, as we’ve worked out all the kinks and come to an understanding about everything that will go into the new web platform. Once development is complete, Client will be back in the fold for the testing trials.

## **Testing & Launch**

We’re almost there. Our new web app is built and ready to launch. But before that happens, We both need to collaborate on a marketing strategy. After all, just because you invested all this time and money into the new app, it doesn’t mean anyone will know it exists unless we tell them.

## **Maintenance**

In the maintenance phase , any necessary enhancements, corrections , and changes will be made to make sure the system continues to work, and stay updated to meet the business goals.
